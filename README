BreakBouncer is a unique Breakout clone mixed with a pong clone which exlores
basic artificial intellegence and is written in C with SDL. It is designed to
be used as an educational tool for people getting involved in game development
who are looking for real examples of how to develop games. Currently it
only supports mac and linux builds and I don't have the tools avaliable to me
to continue to maintain the mac builds. If anyone is interested in maintaining
either of those make files (for windows or mac) then please get in contact with
me. Other then that the code is completely functional and I hope you enjoy.
